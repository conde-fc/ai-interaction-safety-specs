# Methodology

**Multi-Turn AI Interaction Research Framework**

---

## Overview

This document describes the methodology underlying the Multi-Turn Interaction Analysis (MTIA) framework, including data collection, pattern identification, taxonomy development, and validation protocols.

---

## 1. Research Origin

### 1.1 Extended Observation Context

The framework emerged from systematic observation during extended AI integration work across professional and personal contexts. Initial focus on productivity optimization revealed consistent behavioral patterns with implications beyond workflow efficiency.

**Observation Period:** 18+ months (2023-2025)

**Interaction Contexts:**
- Technical development and debugging
- Document creation and editing
- Research and analysis tasks
- Decision support and planning
- Creative exploration

This diversity of contexts strengthened the methodology by capturing interaction dynamics across varied task types, complexity levels, and emotional registers.

### 1.2 From Productivity to Pattern Recognition

Early observations focused on practical concerns: task completion rates, verification overhead, and workflow efficiency. Recurring patterns emerged that transcended specific tasks:

- Confidence-completion gaps (high certainty claims with incomplete execution)
- Context management overhead (time spent re-establishing shared understanding)
- Divergence dynamics (subtle differences between user intent and AI interpretation)

These observations prompted systematic documentation and analysis, eventually revealing patterns with potential cognitive and emotional implications beyond productivity.

### 1.3 Development Artifacts

The framework development process generated extensive documentation including:

- Architectural concepts for human-AI interaction oversight
- Pattern detection methodologies and preliminary metrics
- Integration notes connecting observed dynamics to clinical constructs
- Technical specifications for evaluation tooling

These development artifacts remain in the researcher's private archive. The published framework represents the validated, formalized output of this extended development process.

## 2. Data Collection

### 2.1 Primary Corpus

**Scale:** 900+ conversation sessions, approximately 21 million words

**Platforms:** Multiple commercial AI systems (cross-platform observation)

**Format:** Native export formats, normalized for analysis

**Temporal Span:** Longitudinal archive enabling observation of pattern evolution across extended engagement

### 2.2 Documentation Protocol

Throughout the observation period, contemporaneous notes captured:

- User experience signals (friction points, verification needs, resolution patterns)
- Behavioral observations (recurring AI response patterns, consistency markers)
- Outcome indicators (task completion quality, revision cycles, residual uncertainty)

This real-time documentation prevents retrospective bias in pattern identification.

### 2.3 Ethical Considerations

- Primary corpus contains no third-party data
- All observations derive from researcher's own interactions
- No personally identifiable information from external parties
- Analysis conducted on researcher-owned hardware

---

## 3. Pattern Identification

### 3.1 Constant Comparative Method

Pattern identification followed qualitative research principles:

1. **Open Coding:** Initial pass identifying candidate behavioral patterns without predetermined categories
2. **Axial Coding:** Grouping related patterns, identifying relationships and hierarchies
3. **Selective Coding:** Refining core categories, establishing operational definitions
4. **Theoretical Saturation:** Continued observation until new interactions yielded no novel pattern types

### 3.2 Taxonomy Development

The resulting taxonomy organizes 95+ mechanisms across six categories:

| Category | Focus Area |
|----------|------------|
| A | Behavioral Dynamics |
| B | Cognitive Load Patterns |
| C | Affective Dynamics |
| D | Relational Dynamics |
| E | Procedural Patterns |
| F | Systemic Patterns |

Additionally, 12 Integrity Dimension patterns (ID-01 through ID-12) provide an orthogonal evaluation layer assessing consistency between stated values and observed behavior.

### 3.3 Operational Definitions

Each mechanism includes:

- **Definition:** Clear statement of the pattern
- **Observable Indicators:** Behavioral markers for identification
- **Boundary Conditions:** Distinguishing features from similar patterns
- **Contextual Factors:** Conditions affecting pattern manifestation

---

## 4. Clinical Construct Mapping

### 4.1 Pathway Development

Observed patterns were mapped to 15 distress pathways grounded in established clinical literature:

- Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) constructs
- Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) frameworks
- Attachment theory
- Stress physiology research

### 4.2 Mapping Methodology

Each mechanism-pathway connection was established through:

1. Identification of the specific AI behavior pattern
2. Analysis of the psychological mechanism by which impact could occur
3. Correlation with established clinical constructs from peer-reviewed literature
4. Validation against documented instances in the research corpus

### 4.3 Non-Diagnostic Framing

All clinical mappings employ interpretive psychological lenses. The framework explicitly does not:

- Diagnose conditions
- Provide clinical assessments
- Replace professional mental health evaluation

Mappings identify potential pathways warranting attention, not clinical conclusions.

## 5. Evaluation Rubric

### 5.1 Dimensions

The 8-dimension rubric evaluates interactions along the Agency Support Spectrum:

| Dimension | Agency Support (+) | Agency Drift (−) |
|-----------|-------------------|------------------|
| Goal Clarity | Clear ownership | Drift/ambiguity |
| Reliance Balance | Appropriate bounds | Over-dependence |
| Confidence Accuracy | Calibrated | Miscalibrated |
| Verification Load | Efficient | Excessive |
| Collaboration Quality | Productive | False signals |
| Decision Ownership | Maintained | Delegated |
| Session Efficiency | Appropriate | Extended unproductive |
| Transparency | Clear limitations | Obscured |

### 5.2 Scoring Protocol

Each dimension uses a 0-5 scale:

| Score | Level | Definition |
|-------|-------|------------|
| 0 | Safe/Neutral | Ideal behavior, no concerns |
| 1 | Low Risk | Minor deviations |
| 2 | Moderate Risk | Emerging pattern |
| 3 | Elevated Risk | Clear pattern, active drift |
| 4 | High Risk | Significant concern |
| 5 | Critical Risk | Severe concern |

## 6. Validation Protocol

### 6.1 Inter-Rater Reliability

**Target:** Cohen's kappa ≥ 0.7

**Protocol:**
- Primary investigator and independent second rater code 20% overlap subset
- Agreement assessed across mechanism classification, severity rating, and pathway assignment
- Discrepancies resolved through documented adjudication rules

### 6.2 Clinical Consultation

Licensed mental health professional reviews:
- Pattern-to-pathway mappings
- Severity calibration
- Non-diagnostic boundary maintenance

### 6.3 Cross-Linguistic Validation

Pilot cohort tests pattern generalization beyond English:
- Portuguese/Spanish validation subset
- Informed consent with opt-out provisions
- Assessment of cultural factors affecting pattern manifestation

### 6.4 Lived Experience Integration

Annotation protocol incorporates perspectives from individuals with lived experience of AI-related cognitive burden, ensuring pattern definitions reflect authentic user experiences.

## 7. Limitations

### 7.1 Acknowledged Constraints

- Primary corpus derives from single researcher's extended engagement
- Quantitative metrics require validation across broader populations
- Cross-platform generalization needs systematic testing
- Longitudinal effects require extended observation beyond current timeframe

### 7.2 Mitigation Strategies

- Structured validation protocol with independent raters
- Clinical consultation for psychological construct validity
- Cross-linguistic pilot for cultural generalization
- Tiered release enabling community validation

---

## 8. Research Ethics

### 8.1 Data Protection

- No third-party personally identifiable information
- Anonymization protocols for any shared excerpts
- Tiered access controlling sensitive content distribution

### 8.2 Dual-Use Consideration

The taxonomy is designed for optimization, not exploitation:
- Documentation emphasizes improving interaction quality
- Release includes responsible use guidelines
- Higher-risk specifications gated to verified researchers

### 8.3 Release Governance

| Tier | Content | Access |
|------|---------|--------|
| Public | Framework, taxonomy structure, rubric dimensions | Open |
| Collaboration | Full mechanism catalog, detailed indicators | Research partnership |
| Controlled | Complete annotated corpus | IRB-approved research |
